CONCEPT
 ABSTRACT, PLAYFUL, TOP DOWN ARCADE SHOOTER, For fans of casual slightly absurdist arcade shooters. Featuring replayability through procedural level generation of hazards, obstacles, and enemy spawn patterns. difficulty scaling options, and
THREE ENEMY TYPES WITH UNIQUE BEHAVIORS. 
The Aesthetic will reflect the name of the game, and be somewhat silly.
A stylized and cohesive absurdist design, along with web integrated leaderboards, and polished kinetics will elevate this otherwise straightforward Asteroids clone 

TIMEFRAME
TWO MONTHS
PROJECT DEADLINE
OCT. 12

ASSETS
Player Pawn: Model(2D sprite or Textured FBX), Ability Set, Input map, Sound Map. Death, respawn, firing, idle, and Victory animations.

ENEMIES: Distinct Sound mapping, Model, Behavior, Ability Sets Death, firing, and idle animations for: STANDARD, ELITE, and BOSS enemies.
ENVIRONMENT: Static hazards and obstacles that spawn procedurally on level generation increasing by one for each of the thirty levels, Ambient Background Music that responds to score multipliers, bullet and pawn collision sound and particle response.

GAME LOGIC:  Enemy Behavior, Score Tracking, Score Multipliers based on  hits made without being hit, Player and Enemy HP. All Projectiles will deal one damage point, projectiles will have four distinct speed, shape, and disbursement patterns. The player will have three HP, the standard enemies will have one, the Elite enemies will have 3 and bosses will have 7 and two protective phases. Enemies are worth points based on rank. Player death depletes from life pool of 3, losing all 3 is game over. The kill screen will occur after 30 levels. Level progression is elimination based. Enemies will spawn in a set amount of waves, with various possible spawn configurations that can be defined procedurally at level (or level set*) creation, user editable seed generation.  The final score will be added to a scoreboard along with the seed and a player inputted alias(not authenticated). The scoreboard data will be serialized and organized for live display on a browser. I expect It will be exploitable but functional at launch.


UI: Main menu, Settings Menu, Start Menu. Score total  display, score multiplier display, HP display, Wave counter display, score pop ups (on hit),  Sound Mapping, Title Track. Menu Transitions.

TOOLS/SOFTWARE
Adobe Fresco, PS, Indesign for sprites and Animation
Blender strictly for modeling, all exports would be static FBX.
Unreal Engine for everything else. 

IF THE GAME HAS POTENTIAL TO BE A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT YOU WILL NEED TO ALSO INCLUDE DETAILED PLANS FOR:

                     PUBLISHING
MARKETING

  PIPELINE

Pre-Production
In order to build/acquire the correct/cohesive assets you must spend time defining things such as tone, atmosphere, aesthetic, narrative, characters, cultures through whatever means are available to you. The tools you will use in pre-production will not likely have too much impact in production, so there is no need to get into software at this point. Written descriptions are just as valid as illustrated storyboards or concept art, the important thing is to make production easier on yourself by defining things as explicitly as possible. If written, Include all of the sensory information available. Color, texture, smell, sound. Without spending time doing this you will be wasting time in production. 

EXAMPLE PRE-PRODUCTION PIPELINE
Begin with Worldbuilding: Concept art, MOOD/Story Boards
This can be as simple as sketches or a text document as long as it is detailed.
Establish a rough outline of any applicable plot or narrative.
If narrative is central to your game as it would be in an rpg you will need to be more detailed as you will not want to rewrite your story mid production.

Make a detailed outline of any characters, Include their appearance, aesthetic,  physical attributes, as well as their motivations, fears, and ambitions.

Define core gameplay by breaking down the gameplay loop. Consider things such as Objectives, Rewards, Fail States, and the tools the players will use to achieve or avoid them. Consider how each element in the loop feeds into the next, as this is an important part of creating a satisfying and cohesive experience.
  Re-evaluate the asset list created in this GDD Template.
Only If you have included some level of concept/outline/storyboard/mindmap for each individual asset you plan on using, continue to production.   

Production

During production it is essential to understand the compatibility between different pieces of software. Make sure to describe default export/import settings and file types you will be using at each step of the way. As most if not all logic assets will be built within the game engine, focus instead on creating a cycle of feature prototyping, testing, and completion.
Art Assets will follow a similar cycle, but will likely require several pieces of software to complete. Beginning with the model, describe how the model will be textured, rigged, and animated. Be sure to explain any limitations between software, such as naming conventions and measurement standards.
